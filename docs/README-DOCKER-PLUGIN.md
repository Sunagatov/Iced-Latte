# Maven-Docker Plugin Startup Guide 🚀

Starting up with the Maven-Docker plugin? Here's a step-by-step guide to help you set things up.

## Prerequisites
Before diving in, ensure Maven is already installed on your system.

## Setup Steps 🛠️

1. **Docker Security Configuration** 🛡️:
   - Update the `settings.xml` file with your Docker-specific credentials:
     - `username`
     - `password`
     - `registry`


2. **Master Password Generation** 🔑:
   ```bash
   mvn --encrypt-master-password <your_password_here>
   ```
   Execute the above command to generate your master password.


3. **Repo Password Encryption** 🔄:
   ```bash
   mvn --encrypt-password <your_repository_password_here>
   ```
   After running the above command, replace the original password in the `settings.xml` with the encrypted one.


4. **Build the Project** 🏗️:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
   Kick off the build process with the above command.


5. **Image Verification** 🖼️: Once the build process completes, your code modifications should have been successfully populated into a Docker image. Check your Docker images to confirm.
